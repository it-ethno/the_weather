# The Weather / Das Wetter
A simple HTML/JS app forecasting the weather.

Started out as an assignment of an intermediate course in HTML and JavaScript, and soon became a complete weather app with quite some settings and features.

The app pulls images from Unsplash as background, related to the weather conditions, the location, or even both.

As it uses API keys and is a plain Vanilla JS app (does not use Node), there is no way to deploy it for a public online view right now, but I strongly encourage everyone to download the code, get the necessary keys (OpenWeatherMap, Unsplash, and NASA) and run it from local disk - it is a really nice to-have-around.
